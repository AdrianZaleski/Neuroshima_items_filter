# Neuroshima_items_filter

This is my first coding project for Role Playing Game called "Neuroshima".
Main purpose is for importing data from CSV file (own database made in Google Spreadsheets) and shuffling values according to requested parameters to improve in game trading with players.
Still learning and working so many things are in progress, but basic functionalities are on.
